Hello! I am a research engineer at the [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) who specializes in both AI and physics. I completed my undergraduate studies at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) (ZJU) and obtained my Ph.D. from the [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/) (SUTD). Currently, I am working conducting research on AI for Science and LLM for Knowledge.
